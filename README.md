Implementation from scratch of the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression

Using gradient descent to find the coefficients of a linear equation is not the best solution at all as the coefficient can be directly calculated with variance and covariance. Implementing it from scratch is just a way for me to better understand the gradient descent algorithm.
